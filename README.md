# Ask

This is a quick Go program to make a call to the OpenAI API to ask a question.

Note: This is unfinished because it looks like I don't have any credits with OpenAI and I'm not sure if I should pay for this to experiment personally.

Format:
```
ask "Write a summary for me"
```

Ask reads the OpenAPI key from the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable and uses that to authenticate with the API.
